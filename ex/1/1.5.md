`(test 0 (p))`

Applicative Order:
- operands are evaluated first.
- won't return because (p) recurses indefinitely

Normal Order:
evaluations:
```lisp
(test 0 (p))
;->
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
;->
(if #t 0 (p))
0
```

Even though if is a special form and doesn't evaluate unnecessarily, applicative order forces operand evaluation first when it is passed as an operand to test, so (p) recurses infinitely. Normal order wouldn't have this constraint.
