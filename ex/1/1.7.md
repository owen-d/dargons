The good-enough? test isn't very effective for small numbers. As squares of small numbers are decreasing, the relative threshold (0.001 in the example) actually accounts for an increasing large margin of error as the squares decrease. 

Take this:
```lisp
(square (sqrt 0.00001))
;-> 0.000983
; ~98 times larger
```


For large numbers: I had difficulty reasoning this section out, but found a really good explanation online (included below):
```
On the other hand, for very large values of the radicand, the machine precision is unable to represent small differences between large numbers. The algorithm might never terminate because the square of the best guess will not be within 0.001 of the radicand and trying to improve it will keep on yielding the same guess [i.e. (improve guess x) will equal guess]. Try (sqrt 1000000000000) [that's with 12 zeroes], then try (sqrt 10000000000000) [13 zeroes]. On my 64-bit intel machine, the 12 zeroes yields an answer almost immediately whereas the 13 zeroes enters an endless loop. The algorithm gets stuck because (improve guess x) keeps on yielding 4472135.954999579 but (good-enough? guess x) keeps returning #f.
```

Included in the 1.7.scm file are 2 implementations:
- One which continues until the guess is within a threshold of x. Note that since x is squared, this actually isn't good for large numbers, as sqrts become smaller in a percentage sense as numbers scale higher. This was my first idea and is just included for educational purposes.
- The solution, which stops after guess & lastguess are within a predefined "babystep" of each other.
